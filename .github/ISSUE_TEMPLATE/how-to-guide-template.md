**Be sure to include all needed prerequisites the audience would need to follow your article, by including links to other helpful material and resources.**

NOTE: We encourage you to reach out to your peer community to get your article reviewed for basic grammar and syntax issues before submitting to cut down on the rounds of revisions.

### How-To (use) Guides:
- Give step-by-step instructions for using the software or system
- Proper Syntax
- Conventions
- Errors, Malfunctions, and Emergencies
- Quick-Reference tips
- Screenshot Images

### How-To Guides Overview 
Provide a brief description of the overall processes of the software, and how the user may need to work with the system. 
When needed, reference related processes and corresponding sources.

### What is the Scope and Purpose of the Guide
Introduce the audience to the software or tech you are writing about and explain what is its purpose, and be sure to highlight any of its main benefits and features.

Introduce the purpose of your How-To Guide, what functionalities of the proposed software will you be covering? 
Assume the reader is smart but has no prior exposure to any common terminology or prerequisites about the topic. (cite other EngEd articles or sources if applicable)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Too much text – break up text into more digestable chunks.
- No value – we want to make sure we are bringing unique value to the community, by which we mean NOT content that can be simply found by looking up the official documentation.
- Too short — a guide should have all prerequisites needed and be in depth enough for the audience.
