# Cassandra

[Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) is an open source, distributed NoSQL database. Relational Databases have been used for the last 30 years for various data storage applications, but with the growh of the internet there were different kinds of data that needed to be stored, this data is unstructured, and traditional databases are not easy to scale. 
NoSQL databases are an alternative to traditional SQL databases. 

There are different types of NoSQL databases. 
- Document Databases (Ex: [MongoDB](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/working-with-databases-part1/))
- Key-Value stores
- Graph databases
- Column Stores
- Multimodal databases

You can read about these in detail [here](https://www.mongodb.com/scale/types-of-nosql-databases). SQL and NoSQL databases have their [advantages and disadvantages](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/sql-vs-nosql), this article only focusses on the advatages of using Cassandra as a NoSQL database.
