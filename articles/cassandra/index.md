# Introduction to Apache Cassandra

> Apache Cassandra is an open-source, distributed, decentralised, elastically scalable NoSQL database. 

Cassandra is a distributed database, it can run on multiple machines while appearing to the user as a single node. Cassandra really shines when it is used on multiple-machines, because it is optimized for high performance across
multiple data-center racks and even multiple data-centers across the globe. In other databases as you scale, some nodes need to be setup as primary nodes and some as secondary replicas
, Cassandra is decentralized so there is no concept of primary and secondary, every node is identical. Decentralization is pretty useful as it is easy to use than primary-secondary and there is no single point of failure.
