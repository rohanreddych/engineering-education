## Software Review Template
Drafting a software review to add to the Engineering Education blog? See a suggested structure below you can use and read our highlighted tutorial to discover the standard we're looking for. 

**Tip**: Make sure to provide enough detail and reference other in-depth articles where appropriate. You should provide a broad overview of several aspects of the technology.

**Software Comparison**: A related article to a software review is a software comparison where you compare several similar technologies. An example of this is [comparing several Node.js frameworks](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/hapi-vs-koa-vs-express). Make sure to back up your points, especially if it's contentious. It isn't enough to say React is the best front-end JavaScript framework, for example without a reason behind it. Use statistics and reference other articles.

### Example Article
Here's an excellent [software review](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/transfer-learning-with-deep-learning/) written by one of our Eng-Ed Contributors so you can see the level of detail you should aspire to.

### Table of Contents
Provide the audience a run down on what the article will be covering.

### Brief Summary
Your tech introduction should be a self-contained topic and must be an accurate interpretation of what is presented.

### Introduction of the new technology
A short introduction/description of the technology that is being reviewed. The introduction should contain all needed technical detail for the audience to replicate themselves and it should give the reader a clear understanding of how the technology works.

### Possible Applications
Explain how you have used this technology or how this technology may be used in the future.

### Pros & Cons
Outline the advantages and disadvantages of this new technology from your own experience/point of view and support it using relevant examples and sources.

### Conclusion
Include any next or final steps summarizing the technology introduction - that serves as a good launchpad for the audience. You could link to a tutorial, for example that uses the technology.
